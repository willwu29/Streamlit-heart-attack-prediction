# This application aims to assess your risk of experiencing a heart attack based on various health and lifestyle factors. 
# By filling out the information on the left, the app will use a trained machine learning model to provide a risk assessment. 
# Please ensure to provide accurate information to receive a reliable prediction.

# ### How It Works
# - The model utilizes multiple health indicators to predict heart attack risk.
# - After you fill in the required fields, click on the *Predict Heart Attack Risk* button.
# - The app will calculate the prediction and display the results along with important health guidance.

# ### Disclaimer
